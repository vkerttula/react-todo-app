# React ToDo App powered by Google Firebase


## About
This is my first project with Firebase and React compo, so it is done for learning more about it! In this project, I have used following technologies/languages: 
- React 17
- MUI (Material UI) 
- Google Firebase 
- Firebase Authentication
- Cloud Firestore Database (NoSQL document database)
- etc.

## Usage
The purpose of this ToDo application is to allow the user register and login to own account.
When user is registered, user have ability to add, edit and delete tasks. All modifications is automatically saved to Cloud Firestore Database. 

User is apply to mark task as done, delete tasks and add new tasks. Everything saves to Cloud Firestore in real time. 

Keep in mind that this project was done by learning purposes. It was my first time of using Google Firebase.
